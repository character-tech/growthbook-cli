/**
 * GrowthBook REST API
 * GrowthBook offers a full REST API for interacting with the GrowthBook application. This is currently in **beta** as we add more authenticated API routes and features.  Request data can use either JSON or Form data encoding (with proper `Content-Type` headers). All response bodies are JSON-encoded.  The API base URL for GrowthBook Cloud is `https://api.growthbook.io`. For self-hosted deployments, it is the same as your API_HOST environment variable (defaults to `http://localhost:3100`). The rest of these docs will assume you are using GrowthBook Cloud.  ## Authentication  We support both the HTTP Basic and Bearer authentication schemes for convenience.  You first need to generate a new API Key in GrowthBook. Different keys have different permissions:  - **Personal Access Tokens**: These are sensitive and provide the same level of access as the user has to an organization. These can be created by going to `Personal Access Tokens` under the your user menu. - **Secret Keys**: These are sensitive and provide the level of access for the role, which currently is either `admin` or `readonly`. Only Admins with the `manageApiKeys` permission can manage Secret Keys on behalf of an organization. These can be created by going to `Settings -> API Keys`  If using HTTP Basic auth, pass the Secret Key as the username and leave the password blank:  ```bash curl https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1 \\   -u secret_abc123DEF456: # The \":\" at the end stops curl from asking for a password ```  If using Bearer auth, pass the Secret Key as the token:  ```bash curl https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1 \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer secret_abc123DEF456\" ```  ## Errors  The API may return the following error status codes:  - **400** - Bad Request - Often due to a missing required parameter - **401** - Unauthorized - No valid API key provided - **402** - Request Failed - The parameters are valid, but the request failed - **403** - Forbidden - Provided API key does not have the required access - **404** - Not Found - Unknown API route or requested resource - **429** - Too Many Requests - You exceeded the rate limit of 60 requests per minute. Try again later. - **5XX** - Server Error - Something went wrong on GrowthBook\'s end (these are rare)  The response body will be a JSON object with the following properties:  - **message** - Information about the error
